# Fetching Data From SQL

### <mark style="color:purple;">Introduction</mark>&#x20;

_**The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate with each other using a common set of protocols. It allows users to share information, communicate with each other, and access a vast array of resources such as websites, online services, and applications. The internet is based on a client-server model, where users access resources on the internet by connecting to a server using a device such as a computer or smartphone.**_

_**Or we can Simply Say , All machines around the world is interconnected. Something like this:**_

{% hint style="info" %}
Each Computer is given an address known as `IP Address.` An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," and we are able to fetch data with the help of `IP Address.`
{% endhint %}

But there is a challenge, How would you fetch data from a Machine that is not switched on, or is not simply connected to internet? Then came **servers.**

### <mark style="color:purple;">Servers</mark>&#x20;

**On the World Wide Web, for example, a Web server is a computer that uses the HTTP protocol to send Web pages to a client's computer when the client requests them.**&#x20;

In simple words, Servers used to get Data from Computer A so that even if Computer A is not Connected , Server can send information to client's Computer.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Two Tier Servers :</mark>&#x20;

#### Application Tier Server :&#x20;

An application tier server is a type of server that is used to host and run application software. It is responsible for processing and managing requests from clients, such as web browsers or mobile devices, and delivering the appropriate responses. The application tier server communicates with databases and other back-end systems to retrieve and store data, and it also handles tasks such as authentication, authorization, and session management.

#### Data Tier Server :&#x20;

A data tier server is a type of server that is used to store and manage data. It is responsible for the physical storage, organization, and retrieval of data in a database or other data storage system. The data tier server is separate from the application tier server, which handles the processing and management of requests and responses. Data tier server is also responsible for ensuring the integrity, security and backup of the data.
